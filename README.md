Hey there!
To give a player a certain rank enter ```/luckyperms user <username> parent set <rank>``` in the command line. Only operators can do this!.

The current ranks are ```default``` and ```premium```.

NOTE: There is no system that automaticly defines the
player's rank yet so you will have to manually do this by executing the command above.
